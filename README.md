# BEAT Engine

Numerical BEM, FEM, and lumped electroacoustic solving, extracted from Boundary Lab.
The `beat-engine` Python distribution supplies a standard-library worker client,
versioned wire contracts, Julia CPU/CUDA/ROCm/Metal environments, and numerical
tests. Project authoring, mesh compilation, Qt, and application preferences remain
with the consuming application.

## Local installation

Use Python 3.11+ and install Julia separately (the current qualification uses Julia
1.12). A wheel does not install Julia or GPU drivers.

```text
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m beat_engine instantiate --backend cpu
python -m beat_engine doctor --backend cpu --threads 2
python -m beat_engine paths --backend cpu
```

For CUDA or ROCm, instantiate the matching backend and configure the platform SDK
before running `doctor`. For Metal, instantiate the `metal` backend on Apple
Silicon; no SDK beyond macOS is needed. See [the Metal backend](docs/Metal%20Backend.md). Availability is checked by the worker; it is not inferred
from the package being installed. Importing the package does not install packages,
launch Julia, or modify the environment.

## Public Python API

```python
from beat_engine import EngineWorker, engine_paths

paths = engine_paths("cpu")
worker = EngineWorker(
    julia_executable="julia", solver_script=paths.system_solver,
    julia_project=paths.project, julia_threads=2,
)
try:
    worker.ensure_started()
    print(worker.worker_info)
    # request.json contains a validated compiled-system request with local assets.
    # for event in worker.submit(request_path): ...
finally:
    worker.terminate()
```

`EngineWorker`, `WorkerPool`, `EnginePaths`, and `engine_paths` are the public runtime
API. `beat_engine.beat_contract` exposes model-independent contract validators and
version constants. Submission events are raw JSON records; clients own result
models and display conversion. Drain or close event iterators. Worker paths come
from the installed package, including editable contributor checkouts.

## Tests and releases

```text
python -m pytest
julia --threads=2 --startup-file=no --project=src/beat_engine/julia_local src/beat_engine/julia_local/tests/runtests.jl
julia --threads=2 --startup-file=no --project=src/beat_engine/julia_local src/beat_engine/julia_local/tests/reference_tests.jl
```

The required CPU reference gate has 464 checks including analytical complex
pressure, independent excitations, symmetry, FEM modes, and coupled transducer
comparisons. See its [coverage notes](src/beat_engine/julia_local/tests/README.md).
The manual Accelerator qualification workflow uses self-hosted runners labeled
`cuda`, `rocm`, or `metal`, with Python, Julia, and the matching SDK preinstalled. It requires
the requested backend to be functional before running the numerical gates.
GPU qualification remains hardware-specific; CPU success does not qualify GPU
backends. Some historical research scripts and the optional noncubic-cavity test
still require Boundary Lab's extended fixtures; they are not installed runtime
requirements or part of the portable release gate.

Exterior-only compiled-system CUDA and Metal solves default to direct
Burton–Miller assembly. CUDA uses the same assembler as Deploy; Metal uses its
fused assembler, which forms the system on the GPU and factorizes once on the
host because Metal.jl has no GPU LU. One pivoted LU factorization serves all
excitation right-hand sides at a frequency. Set the solver option
`burton_miller_assembly` to `operator_matrices` for the previous assembly path;
CPU and ROCm continue to use that path. The result diagnostics report the
effective assembly mode and factorization count. Coupled FEM-BEM solves are
unaffected by this exterior option.

Coupled CUDA solves without full diagnostics now default to combined A/C
Burton-Miller assembly, job-cached sparse interface projection, and fused symmetry
images. The original operator path remains available for comparisons and full
diagnostics. Coupled Metal solves assemble the four operators on the GPU and run
the coupled algebra, including FEM static condensation, on the host. Register caps are explicit hardware tuning options; the compiler
default is preserved. See [coupled CUDA architecture and controls](docs/Coupled%20CUDA%20Assembly.md).

The stable package release is `0.1.0`. CI builds a wheel after independent
Python and CPU checks on Windows, Linux, and macOS. The manually dispatched release
workflow requires a successful CI run for the tag's exact commit before attaching
wheel/sdist artifacts to a stable GitHub release. No PyPI publication is configured.
